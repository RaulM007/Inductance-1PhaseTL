# Inductance-1PhaseTL
MATLAB code for calculate the inductance of a one phase transmission line. 
Instruccions
Linea1FaseADD is a data archive where the specifications of each conductor must be indicated.
Conductors specifications: radius and position.
Positions of each conductor have to be represented as a pair (X, Y), where X represents an horizontal displacement in the plane, and Y stands for a vertical displacement.
